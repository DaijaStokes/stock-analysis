# Project Overview
The purpose of this profect was to use VBA and Excel functions to loop through the data set and refractor our already exsiting code. The dataset VBA_Challenge.xlms used in this project was refractored to loop though the data of many stock markets that were created over the last few years. This project refractor was created so that the VBA script could execute faster. In these next sections I will be providing screenshots of the analysis I took from this refractored code that compares teh stock performances between 2017 and 2018. 
## Stock Analysis 2017
In this below screenshot, we see the output of executing the code, "yearValue = InputBox("What year would you like to run the analysis on?")"

This inputbox then is used to analyze the stock analysis for the year entered, in this example 2017.
You can see from this screenshot the amount of time that is took to run through this data and output this analysis.
