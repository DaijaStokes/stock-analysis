# Overview of Stock Analysis
The purpose of this Stock Analysis overal was to display Louise's successes failures and cancelations during her campaigns. Louise's budgets and goals based off a variety of categories and subcategories were also displayed in this stock analysis. The color coded items in this analysis for each campaign allow the reader to easily visualize outliers in the data. The different line charts show the trends of the percentages over a difference in goals. The pivot table used to count the outcomes quickly summarize the large amounts of data based on the different categories. Filters can be used in this pivot table to change which country the data is filtered by.

Above the screenshot shows the outcomes of the plays subcategory based on the actual goat for each. In this visualization I faced a challenge with using the COUNTIFS() function. I then refered to the official documentation.<img width="493" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 6 28 11 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77857472/148705557-7fcb765d-e30e-49d6-9322-51260b27b0b6.png">


This site was used for me to remind myself how to calculate the percentages of two columns -> [Percentage of two columns](https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-calculate-the-percentage-of-two-numbers-in-Excel).

My challenges faced in this screenshot were that I could properly display months in the rows. [This link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/group-or-ungroup-data-in-a-pivottable-c9d1ddd0-6580-47d1-82bc-c84a5a340725?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) allowed me to group the data based off of the years and then scale down to the months.

# Results
You can also see from the Line Chart of the Outcomes Based on Goals that most of the successful outcomes had a greater success rate of 60% or more until the goal range increased to $45,000 to $50,000.
Also from this chart you see that no matter what the goal amount was none of the plays were ever canceled.
